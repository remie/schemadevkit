# Schema Validation

* Version: 0.9.1
* Author: Remie Bolte <http://github.com/remie>
* Build Date: 2011-08-31
* Requirements: Symphony 2.2.3, debugdevkit extension

Special thanks go out to the developers of the debugdevkit extension and to Alistair Kearney for creating the Schema Validation example (http://sandbox.pointybeard.com/validate-xml/ and http://sandbox.pointybeard.com/validate-xml/index.phps)
In it's current BETA phase, the extension relies heavily on the 'debugdevkit'. It has to be reviewd if the extension needs to be merged or made available as a stand-alone feature.
